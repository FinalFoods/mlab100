# Espressif ESP32 Partition Table
#
# 4M:
#   0000->0FFF  secure boot digests (ESP32 opaque/private)
#   1000->8000  bootloader
#   8000->8BFF  partition table
#
# Do NOT change the phy_init or default app partition offsets without
# also modifying the relevant sdkconfig options.
#
# NOTEs:
# - The "encrypted" flag is ignored if the build does not have flash
#   encryption enabled.
# - It is not necessary to mark "app" partitions as encrypted, since
#   they are always treated as encrypted if flash encryption is
#   enabled,
# - It is *NOT* possible to mark the "nvs" partitions as encrypted.
# - Application partitions *MUST* be aligned on a 64K (0x10000)
#   boundary.
